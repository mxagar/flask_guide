# Flask Guide

These are my personal notes and examples on how to work with Flask for web development.

I created this repository following online tutorials and the Udemy course by Jos√© Portilla [Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask).

Note that Python knowledge and some web development skills are required. For the latter, have a look at [jekyll_web_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/jekyll_web_guide) `/ html_css_bootstrap_guide.md`.

# 1. Flask Basics

Installation:

```bash
# Select environment
conda activate ds
# Install if not done yet
conda install -c anaconda flask  -y
conda install -c anaconda flask-wtf  -y
```

## Hello World Example

`./examples/01_basics/hello_world.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__) # __name__ is __main__

# We pass to the instantiated Flask app
# the pages we want in the rout we like
# Here: an index page function located in the root
@app.route('/')
def index():
	# In this case, we directly return HTML code
    return '<h1>Hello World!</h1>'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

```

To run it:

```bash
cd examples/
python hello_world.py
# Open browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
# To finish web server: Ctrl+C
```

## Basic Routes

With `@app.route()` we define the name of the page we are creating:

```python
@app.route('/some_page') # http://127.0.0.1:5000/some_page
def index():
	return '<h1>Hello World!</h1>'
# We create:
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/some_page
# When deployed, the DNS is changed:
# http://my_domain.com/some_page

# We can create as many pages we want.
@app.route('/information') # http://127.0.0.1:5000/information
def info():
	return '<h1>Important info: ...</h1>'

# If we try to access a page that doesn't exist
# we get a 404 error: Not found
```

## Dynamic Routes

With dynamic routes we pass variables to the page functions. The effect is that we can type the matching URL address we want, i.e., we pass the variable name through the browser. Then, that variable is caught by the page function and it can process it as desired.

One possible application are custom user pages:

`./examples/01_basics/dynamic_route.py`

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

# Main page
@app.route('/') # http://127.0.0.1:5000
def index():
    return '<h1>Hello World!</h1>'

# We can add as many pages we want with route.
@app.route('/information') # http://127.0.0.1:5000/information
def info():
    return '<h1>About page</h1>'

# Dynamic routing: we pass a variable that changes the URL name
# The idea is that the page is created when we enter the address,
# i.e., we pass the variable via the web browser!
# Then, that variable can be processed in the page function.
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/mikel -> URL accepted and content modified
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/unai -> URL accepted and content modified
# We can apply changes to name: name.upper(), etc.
@app.route('/user/<name>') 
def puppy(name):
    # Page for an individual puppy.
    return '<h1>This is a page for {}<h1>'.format(name.upper())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

```

```bash
cd examples/
python dynamic_route.py
# Open browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/information
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/mikel -> check that content is modified with MIKEL
# To finish web server: Ctrl+C
```

## Debug Mode

We can activate debug mode in the application as follows:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

That way, if we have an error in any of the page functions, instead of displaying an "Internal Server Error" page, we get a traceback list of all the steps until the first error.

We can also open an interactive python debugging console clicking on the traceback step icon for that; but **we need a PIN**. The PIN is displayed on the terminal/shell when we run the python script.

NOTE: debug mode should be deactivated when we deploy to production!


# 2. Templates

Instead of returning HTML strings, we usually render a template HTML file. These are **templates** and they are rendered with the function `render_template(html_filepath)`.

Templates need to be located in a folder called `templates/` and they can use resources from other locations, e.g., image files.

## Basic Template

All the HTML template files need to be in `templates/`. The resources they use can be anywhere, e.g., in this case, they are in the folder `static/`.

Basic example in `./examples/02_templates`.

`templates/basic-template.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Basic</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Here is a cute picture of a puppy!</h2>
    <!-- The image can be located anywhere, but the HTML file in templates/-->
    <img src="../static/puppy_pic.jpg" width="600" height="400">

  </body>
</html>

```

`basic_template.py`:

```python
# Run: python basic_template.py

# Import the render_template function
from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)

# Render an HTML template file
# All templates are located in the folder templates (Flask looks for that name)
# This template uses an image in the folder static
# The folder name with the resources is arbitrary
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Connecting to a template (html file)
    return render_template('basic-template.html')

# Debug mode active; deactivate to go to production
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

## Template Variables with Jinja

We can use [Jinja templating](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/), as in Jekyll, to inject variables from the python script in the HTML document visualized with `render_template()`; simply, the variables are created inside the page function and passed directly to `render_template()`. Then, we access them with Jinja notation in the HTML document. We can pass strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.

Basic example in `./examples/02_templates`.

`variables.py`

```python
# Run: python variables.py

from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Pass in a puppy name
    # We insert it to the html with jinja2 templates!
    return '<h1> Go to /puppy/name </h1>'

@app.route('/puppy/<name>')
def adv_puppy_name(name):
    # Pass in a puppy name
    # We insert it to the html with Jinja templates!
    message = "Trying variables."
    letters = list(name)
    pup_dict = {'pup_name':name}
    return render_template('variables-template.html',
                           message=message,
                           name=name,
                           mylist=letters,
                           mydict=pup_dict)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

`templates/variables-template.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Basic</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The message is defined in render_template() and passed to the HTML -->
    <h1>{{message}}</h1>
    <!-- name is passed via the browser to the python script and from there to he HTML via render_template() -->
    <h1>Basic variable insert: {{name}}!</h1>
    <!-- Recall that we set mylist=letters in the .py file. -->
    <!-- You could use whatever variable names you want -->
    <h1>List example: {{mylist}}</h1>
    <!-- We can index the list as well -->
    <h1>Indexing the list for the first letter: {{mylist[0]}}</h1>
    <!-- We can also use dictionaries -->
    <h1>Puppy name from dictionary: {{mydict['pup_name']}}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Template Control Flow with Jinja

While with Jinja variables we use `{{ variable }}` within the HTML text, we need to use `{% ... %}` for control flow statements, i.e., `if, for`, etc. Inside them, we can access the variables.

Examples:

```html
<ul>
    {% for item in mylist %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% if username == "Mikel" %}
    <h1>Insert credit card number.</h1>
{% elif username == "Unai" %}
    <h1>Ask your parents.</h1>
{% else %}
    <h1>You're not authenticated.</h1>
{% endif %}
```

Example in the `examples/` folder:

`control_flow.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    puppies = ['Fluffy','Rufus','Spike']
    return render_template('control-flow-template.html',
                           puppies=puppies)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

`templates/control-flow-template.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Here we use a for loop for a list</p>
    <ul>
      {% for pup in puppies %}
      <li>{{pup}}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <p>We can also add if/else statements:</p>
    {% if 'Rufus' in puppies %}
      <p>Found you in the list of puppies Rufus!</p>
    {% else %}
      <p>Hmm, Rufus isn't in this list.</p>
    {% endif %}
  </body>
</html>
```
