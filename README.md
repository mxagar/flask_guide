# Flask Guide

These are my personal notes and examples on how to work with Flask for web development.

I created this repository following online tutorials; particularly interesting ones are:

- The Udemy course by Jos√© Portilla [Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask).
- The [Udacity Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

Contents:

- `flask_guide.md`: guide to learn/use Flask
- `examples/`: folder with examples referenced from `flask_guide.md`.

Note that Python knowledge and some web development skills are required. For the latter, have a look at [jekyll_web_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/jekyll_web_guide) `/ html_css_bootstrap_guide.md`. That repository also contains notes on how to create static websites (including blogs) with Jekyll.
